**printer73x** is a CNC system for printing binary images.  printer73x
was developed for the school courses *734 - PROYECTO DE IMTC I* and *735
- PROYECTO DE IMTC II* (spanish for *mechatronics project*) at `FIME
<http://www.fime.uanl.mx/en/>`_ `UANL <http://www.uanl.mx/>`_.
printer73x has only been tested on Windows XP and Fedora 15 but will
work on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Mac OS X, and most Linux
distributions.  The software is written mainly in Python and MATLAB.

printer73x 1.0.2 is released for educational purposes.  I'm (Pedro I.
López) currently trying to persuade the mechanical design team to
publicly release the documentation for the structure (*printerm*), but
for the moment this distribution doesn't include it.
